Because the rains - reportedly the worst seen in the area since 1994 - came on the heels of the UN World Food Programme's February distribution, refugees have lost an entire month's food supply, a WFP official told IRIN on Wednesday. Heavy, concentrated rains [at the end of last week] basically melted houses, administration buildings, the Red Cross building and schools, said Michelle Iseminger, head of WFP's office in Tindouf, Algeria.
